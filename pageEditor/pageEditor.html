                <p>Created the Billing page  with a favour of HTML and CSS
                    <br>To create a feedback page for my climate change website, I first built the HTML framework, which included form elements such as input fields and dropdown menus. 
                    <br>Then I used CSS to improve the visual appeal and assure responsiveness across a variety of devices.
                    <br>With JavaScript, I created form validation to guarantee that user input was proper, and I even contemplated including a preview feature for user feedback. 
                    <br>After extensive testing with various browsers and devices, I smoothly incorporated the page into my website's menu bar for simple access. 
                    <br>The combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript produced a functional and visually appealing feedback page for my website.
                    <br>
